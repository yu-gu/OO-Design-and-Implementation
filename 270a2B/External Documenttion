A.
1.
Q:how to execute the test of the class:
A:all functions in all classes have been called in the main function of each class file, outputs of all funcions has been recorded and each has a standard answer and actual answer to see if they are matched (details in output file)

2.
Q:what is neccessary to compile classes?
A:fields and constructors in each class are neccessary to be compiled.

(For Person class: fields->Name PhoneNumber | constructor
 For Booking class: fields->person flight seat| constructor
 For BasicFlight class: fields->number width seatlimit ticket[] | constructor)

3.
Q:programs to show execution of the program
A:the static main method in each class file are used to execute class individually. Another class with main method only is used for application.

(Note: the additional external testingDemo class is not used for testing but for the overall application of flight reservation system to demonstrate the connections and integrity between all classes)


B.
All functions in all classes are working well and thoroughly tested. 

(i.e, accessor methods by output directly mutator methods are tested by ouput after calling the method, which is demonstrated in output file only if the output match the standard answer.)
